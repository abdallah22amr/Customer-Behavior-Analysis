Customer Behavior Analysis

Project Overview
- This project analyzes customer shopping behavior to identify purchasing patterns, spending habits, and demographic impacts.
- Python was used for cleaning, SQL for analysis, and Power BI for visualization.

Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw data
- Identify top products and customer segments
- Compare subscribers vs. non-subscribers
- Analyze discount and rating effects
- Build an interactive BI dashboard

Data Cleaning (Python)
Performed with Pandas:
- Filled missing ratings using median by category
- Normalized and renamed columns
- Created age groups using quantiles
- Mapped frequency terms to numeric days
- Dropped redundant columns

SQL Analysis
After importing data into SQL Server, business questions were answered such as:
- Total revenue by gender
- Spending comparison between subscribers and non-subscribers
- Top products by review rating
- Effect of discounts on purchase amount
- Revenue by age group

Power BI Dashboard
The dashboard includes:
- Revenue, average purchase, and rating KPIs
- Segmentation by age group, subscription, and category
- Filters for gender and shipping type

Key Insights
- Subscribers spend about 25% more than non-subscribers
- Clothing and accessories dominate total revenue
- Young and middle-aged customers lead in spending
- Discounts raise volume but not revenue per order
- Express shipping yields higher order value

Tools
Python (Pandas)
SQL Server
Power BI

Future Work
- Add predictive analytics and customer segmentation
- Automate ETL and data refresh
- Explore advanced clustering techniques
